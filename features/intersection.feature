Feature: Intersections

Scenario: An intersection encapsulates t and object
  Given s ← sphere()
  When i ← intersection(3.5, s)
  Then i.t = 3.5
    And i.object = s

Scenario: Aggregating intersections
  Given s ← sphere()
    And i1 ← intersection(1, s)
    And i2 ← intersection(2, s)
  When xs ← intersections(i1, i2)
  Then xs.count = 2
    And xs[0].t = 1 And xs[1].t = 2

Scenario: Intersect sets the object on the intersection
  Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
    And s ← sphere()
  When xs ← intersect(s, r)
  Then xs.count = 2
    And xs[0].object = s
    And xs[1].object = s

Scenario: A sphere is behind a ray
  Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, -2.5), vector(0, 0, 0.5))
    And s ← sphere()
  When xs ← intersect(s, r)
  Then xs.count = 2
    And xs[0].t = 3.0
    And xs[1].t = 7.0

Scenario: The hit, when all intersections have positive t
  Given s ← sphere()
    And i1 ← intersection(1, s)
    And i2 ← intersection(2, s)
    And xs ← intersections(i2, i1)
  When i ← hit(xs)
  Then i = i1

Scenario: The hit, when some intersections have negative t
  Given s ← sphere()
    And i1 ← intersection(-1, s)
    And i2 ← intersection(1, s)
    And xs ← intersections(i2, i1)
  When i ← hit(xs)
  Then i = i2

Scenario: The hit, when all intersections have negative t
  Given s ← sphere()
    And i1 ← intersection(-2, s)
    And i2 ← intersection(-1, s)
    And xs ← intersections(i2, i1)
  When i ← hit(xs)
  Then i is nothing

Scenario: The hit is always the lowest nonnegative intersection
  Given s ← sphere()
    And i1 ← intersection(5, s)
    And i2 ← intersection(7, s)
    And i3 ← intersection(-3, s)
    And i4 ← intersection(2, s)
    And xs ← intersections(i1, i2, i3, i4)
  When i ← hit(xs)
  Then i = i4

Scenario: Precomputing the state of an intersection
  Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
    And shape ← sphere()
    And i ← intersection(4, shape)
  When comps ← prepare_computations(i, r)
  Then comps.t = i.t
    And comps.object = i.object
    And comps.point = point(0, 0, -1)
    And comps.eyev = vector(0, 0, -1)
    And comps.normalv = vector(0, 0, -1)

Scenario: The hit, when an intersection occurs on the outside
  Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
    And shape ← sphere()
    And i ← intersection(4, shape)
  When comps ← prepare_computations(i, r)
  Then comps.inside = false

Scenario: The hit, when an intersection occurs on the inside
  Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, 0), vector(0, 0, 1))
    And shape ← sphere()
    And i ← intersection(1, shape)
  When comps ← prepare_computations(i, r)
  Then comps.point = point(0, 0, 1)
    And comps.eyev = vector(0, 0, -1)
    And comps.inside = true
    # normal would have been (0, 0, 1), but is inverted!
    And comps.normalv = vector(0, 0, -1)
